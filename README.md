# Preface

I usually like to make some modifications for the colorschemes I love to match my personal preference. In the past, I had three options:

- Creating a PR for that colorscheme: It's my own preference, and I don't think it's likely to be accepted.
- Maintaining my own fork: I need to track the upstream updates myself.
- Writing ad hoc code for different colors in my `.vimrc`: Ugly.

Therefore, I created this plugin to centralize all colorscheme patches in one place, typically in my dotfiles repository, and have them load automatically when I type `:color xxx` .
